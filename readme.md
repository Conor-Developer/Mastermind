In this project, I have created the game Mastermind, which is played via the command line using Ruby. The aim of developing this project is to further expand my knowledge of the OOP model.

The game has two options:

  Option 1:

  * Choose 4 numbers between 1-6 (no spaces) (e.g. 1234) to guess the computers secret code.
  * Not only do you need to find the correct numbers, but also the correct combination.
  * You will be provided 12 rounds to solve the secret code.

  * There are two different clues that may be provided each round:

    One (red) clue indicates one of your four pegs is not only correct, but it's also in the correct position within the secret code.

    The other (white) clue indicates one of your four pegs is correct, however it's not in the correct position within the secret code.

    Option 2:

    * Create the secret code by choosing 4 coloured pegs (between 1-6).
    * The computer will be provided 12 rounds to guess your secret code.


    The easiest method to play this game is via Replit: https://replit.com/@ConorRuby/Mastermind#main.rb

    Alternatively, you can download the repository and run the mastermind.rb file via the command line.
